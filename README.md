# hello_world

Working on Programming Principles and Practice by Bjarne Stroustrup, am taking CS50, and I just got the official Arduino starter kit! I've coded on a few learning sites like code.org and I enjoy Khanacademy and opensource learning.

Science Fiction is a huge inspiration and motivation to code. If you can code it's like being able to do magic.
